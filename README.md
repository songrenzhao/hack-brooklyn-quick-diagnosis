# Hack Brooklyn 2020 - Team Quick Diagnosis

Hello, we are Songren Zhao and Chris Huang. We are excited to demonstrate our project Quick Diagnosis for the Hack Brooklyn hackathon.

During the time of the Coronavirus pandemic, we are grateful to all people who are fighting on the frontline. We acknowledge that mental health problems such as overreacting and overthinking can cause serious concerns. It might be alright to visit a healthcare facility if we are not in a crisis, however health care resources are important during this time and they should go to those who need them the most. 

Therefore we are offering a platform for everyone to maintain mental health and relieve any concerns. Powered by Infermedica, Quick Diagnosis helps people to identify possible conditions and advise related to their symptoms.
